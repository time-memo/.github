## Welcome to Timemo👋

### Think of future, connect with the past
Timemo is at its core a messaging tool, with few constraints: 
- the recipient is you
- the time of delivery is in the future (think about years)

Think of it as a time vault, once you seal it, there is no opening or editing the content until the day of. 

### Why?
Diaries are written with present in mind, focusing on our current state of mind. What Timemo is trying to do is take the context of present but think about the future.
From the perspective of the you that is writting, it forces you to look at the bigger picture, think about the unknown and maybe even set yourself some goals. From the perspective
of the you that is then reading, it is a great retrospective moment, to see the large changes that escape us in the incrementals of day to day life, to remind yourself of who you were.
